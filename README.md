# Password Generator Starter Code
The password Generator was probably the most difficult challenge at this point of the course.

Although I did end up getting the prompts to work and have them store data, I wasn't able to figure out the actual math
to generate the password. 

As you can see the starter code had a regular website and a button in the middle

When clicking on the button, the first window will pop out from the top

entering anything above 128 or entering anything below 8 will prevent you from continuing

Next it will ask if you want any Lowercase letters

then it will ask you if you want upper

You will be asked if you want to use Special characters

Lastly you will be asked if you want numbers or not

If you don't answer with a yes (y) or a No (n), you will be asked to type an appropriate answer

once done it will store all the answers in the code

My plan for the generated password was to have a separate array, and store individual items from other arrays that have the characters
and store it randomly. 
This ended up taking a lot of time, so I wasn't able to finish but I'm sure I could of gotten it.
